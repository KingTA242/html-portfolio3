<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Jeepers Creepers</h3>
<p>Best horror movie of all time. The Creeper is one of the most unique movie monsters in a long time. Very interestin story and the lack of a back story adds to the mystery.
</p>
<h3>Ghost Busters</h3>
<p>This is a classic. If you haven't watched this as yet then you are at a disadvantage of the level of joy you can possibly achieve in life. Great cast, great story and beautiful special effects for its time that aged well.
</p>
<h3>DBZ</h3>
<p>This is bigger that just a movie. The Dragon Ball franchise in its entirety is one of the best things on plannet earth. Top tier animations, characters, story and evolution of a warrior at its best. Check it out before you check out.</p>
